# Natural Language Inference BOW, Word Embeddings and Symbolic Experiments at ASSIN-2 Dataset

In this repo, we conduct a preliminary analysis of different methods
to address the Textual Entailment Recognition (RTE) task in Portuguese. We use
the ASSIN-2 dataset as a benchmark to evaluate our models. Our work combines
various textual representation approaches, including bag of words and word em-
beddings, with machine learning models. Additionally, we present a rule-based
approach. Our highest performance was achieved by the BERTimbau-large
model fine-tuned on ASSIN-2, which attained an F 1 score of 0.89%, positioning
it just 1% below the current state-of-the-art. Our ongoing experiment aims to
combine our different approaches to leverage their full potential.

This repo was created as part of an activity from the Natural Language Processing course at ICMC - USP.
